# Kaggle-USPTO Explainable AI for Patent Professionals

## Competition Overview

The **Kaggle-USPTO Explainable AI for Patent Professionals** competition is featured on Kaggle. This repository contains the code and model developed for this competition.

### Objective

The primary objective of this competition is to generate Boolean search queries that accurately represent collections of patent documents. The goal is to develop a model that, given a set of related patents, outputs a Boolean query capable of retrieving the same set of documents.

This solution aims to assist patent professionals by providing AI-powered search tools that use familiar Boolean query language and syntax. By bridging AI and traditional Boolean search methods, this project supports the effective and responsible adoption of AI technology in the intellectual property (IP) ecosystem.
