Kaggle-USPTO Explainable AI for Patent Professionals

Kaggle Featured Competition

Bronze Solution

Model: Annealing Mehtod

This repository contains the code and model developed for the USPTO Explainable AI for Patent Professionals competition hosted on Kaggle.

# Overview

The objective of the competition is to generate Boolean search queries that accurately represent collections of patent documents. The goal is to create a model that, given a set of related patents, outputs a Boolean query capable of retrieving the same set of documents.

This solution aims to assist patent professionals in using AI-powered search tools with greater confidence by providing familiar Boolean query language and syntax. By bridging AI and traditional Boolean search methods, this project supports the effective and responsible adoption of AI technology in the intellectual property (IP) ecosystem.
